- Feature engineering: global/per-feature lags, rolling means, EMA, (optional) PCA
- Feature selection on engineered features (variance filter + |Pearson corr|)
- Models: ElasticNet, RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and baselines (Mean, RandomWalk, AR1)
- Flexible search between FE candidates and HP grid (fast vs. full factorial)
